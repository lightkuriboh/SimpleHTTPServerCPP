# INSTALLATION  

#### SERVER  
```
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
# Run
$ ./build/DTLMiniProject
```
* You may need to increase OpenFiles Limit (ulimit -n) to 20000 in local environment to handle more connections. 

#### WRK (FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING)  
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev git -y
$ git clone https://github.com/wg/wrk.git wrk
$ cd wrk
$ sudo make
# move the executable to somewhere in your PATH, ex:
$ sudo cp wrk /usr/local/bin
```   

# FEATURES SUPPORTED  
* Multiple clients to connect to the server at the same time.  
* Supports HTTP/1.1 (persistent connection).  
* Get the response by request type and endpoint.  
    * "GET /" : return home page.  
    * "GET /about" : return about page.   
* Get files (image, text, ...)  
    * "GET /{fileName}": return that file to the client.  

# EXPLANATION
```  
* I maintained a file descriptor for listening socket called socketMaster. The socketMaster is responsible for listening port PORT (PORT = 2101 for default).
   
* To monitor events on the file descriptors, I used epoll, a data structure used to monitor events on file descriptors (the Red-Black Tree is used).
 
* First, I created an epollContext with epoll_create() and I register socketMaster to the epollContext.

* I use epoll_wait() to get the file descriptors that are ready for I/O.
   
* When there is any I/O event on the socketMaster, that means there is a connection is coming.

* Then I accept() to open another socket to deal with that connection and register it to the epollContext.

* If an event is seen on the file descriptor other than socketMaster, base on the type of event, I will handle it.
   * When an EPOLLIN event occurs, then there is a request, I will handle that request and send some response to the client via that corresponding socket.
   * When an EPOLLERR or EPOLLHUP event occurs, I will close that connection.

* When the server is starting up, I load static HTML files (css and js too, but I just loaded HTMLs for now) to respond based on the request's method and endpoint.

* The server supports transfering files. If you open "/about" page, you can see the browser is loading "about.css", "about.js" and images.

* I used a Thread Pool to handle "heavy" request (may be transfering a file, search in database, ...). I completed so late because there has been an error with the anonymous function when I called "[&](){}", which resulted in replacing variables' values when the thread is executed.   
First the "pool" is created with X thread(s) as X workers, which are infinitely looking into a mutex-locked queue of tasks.  
Whenever the "worker" takes a task from the queue, it just executes it.

# TESTING PERFORMANCE  
```
$ ./wrk -t1 -c10000 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:2101  
# Testing with 10000 connections kept openned within 30s by 1 thread  
```
